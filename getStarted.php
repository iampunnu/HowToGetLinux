<h4>
 
 Now you're probably at the point where you're half-convinced by all these arguments, thinking that Linux seems to be a pretty 
 neat thing to at least try, but you're kind of afraid to make the big jump. 
 How do you know one of the tools/applications you use every day won't be lacking with Linux? 
 Will you spend all that energy backing up your data, installing a new system. <br/> only to find that you really can't live 
 with it because it's missing feature X?
 I do believe trying out a Live CD should help you determine whether Linux is really made for you or whether you're not
 ready yet.<br> 
 However, even before that, I thought it would be good to show you a few screenshots of a typical day using 
 Linux, with a few different pieces of sofware, just to show you how it's like, let you visit this new house for a couple of
 hours before you decide to rent it. After all, you spend quite a bit of time with your computer everyday, you might as well
 make the right decision!<br> 
 This is a screenshot tour taking the example of the Ubuntu Linux flavor. Of course all the colors,
 wallpapers, themes, etc., are very easily customizable! What you will see here is merely the system default.
When you enter your Linux desktop for the first time, you will see something like this:<br><br>

<br><br>
Very clean, very simple, no clutter on your Desktop (until you put your stuff in there!). So where to start? The Applications menu
 is a good starting point if you want to start working, where your software is neatly organized into categories (and, as we 
 mentioned earlier, everything you're likely to use right away is already installed):<br><br>

 <br><br>
 If you need something that's not installed yet, just load the "Ubuntu Software Center" (or the equivalent tool for the Linux flavor 
 you'll choose) for the Applications menu. If you want to browse through your available files, the Places menu gives you plenty
 of handy shortcuts (all are obviously customizable):<br><br>

 Which applications do you use the most? If you're like most people, you won't be able to work properly without a very good 
 web browser. Firefox comes preinstalled:<br><br>

 <img src="images/D4.png" alt="DesktopApps2">

 <br><br>
 But you can easily install other browsers, such as Chrome.<br><br>
 <center>

 <br><br>
 The Linux versions for these browsers are pretty much the same as their Windows counterpart, so you should feel pretty 
 familiar there. Many people like to check their email online, with web applications like Gmail, Yahoo Mail or Hotmail -- in
 that case all you need is a web browser. But many like to process their email in a local application. Thunderbird
 is the default here, and should look familiar:<br><br>

 <br><br>
 But many others are available, such as Evolution. Your usual office-like suite of application is probably a place where you 
 spend quite a bit of time. A good choice is the online Google Apps tools which works great for sharing and making your 
 documents available from any computer, but if you prefer to run the software on your computer,<br><br>

 All of these should look very similar to what you already use. The default PDF document viewer is also nice, simple but very
 powerful:<br><br>
