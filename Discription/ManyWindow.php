 <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> Too many windows? Use workspaces. </h1>
<h4>
 <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">1. </em> I never was a Windows user and there is something I just cannot understand:
  once you have your word processor, your web browser, your email application, your instant messenger software and some windows
  open to explore your files, how do Windows users manage not to get lost in this clutter?
  <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
 <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">2. </em> Workspaces is a feature I would never trade for anything else. You  probably
  only have one screen, right? Try Linux, and you have four. Well, you can't actually look at the four of them at the same
  time, but this doesn't matter since your eyes can't look in two directions at once, right? 
  <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
  <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">3. </em> On the first screen, lets put your word processor. On the second one,
   your instant messenger software. On the third one, your web browser. So when you're writing something in your word processor
   and you want to check out something on the web, no need to review all your windows to find your browser, stacked all the way
   behind the others. You just switch to your third screen, here it is.
