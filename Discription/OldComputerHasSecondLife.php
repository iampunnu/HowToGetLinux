<h4>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">1. </em> Windows requires more and more hardware power as its version number 
 increases (95, 98, 2000, Me, XP, etc.). So if you want to keep running Windows, you need to constantly buy new hardware. 
 But I can't see any good reason for so fast an evolution. Of course, many people need a lot of computer power and new
 hardware and technologies are really helping them.
<div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">2. </em> But for most users, who surf the web, read and write emails, write text files
 and slides, what's the point of buying a new computer every 2, 3 or 4 years, apart from letting computer vendors earn more
 money? What is exactly the profound reason why your computer can't do any more of what it did perfectly well 5 years ago?
<div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">3. </em> Linux runs perfectly well on older hardware, on which Windows 7 would 
probably even refuse to install, or leave you waiting for 20 seconds after each click. Of course, Linux won't make a race-winner
out of your 12-year old computer, but it will run very well on it and allow you to perform usual tasks (surfing the web, writing
 documents, etc.) just fine. 
<div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">4. </em> The very computer that delivers this page to you is not very young and runs 
Linux: if you can read this, then it is up and running (and if the website loads slowly, blame my Internet connection only).
