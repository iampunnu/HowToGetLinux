  <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> why would you still need to install stuff?</h1> 
<h4>
 1. Installing Windows is just the beginning. Imagine you just installed your brand new copy of Windows 7 and prepare to
   unleash your computer skills. A friend sends you an email with an attached PDF file : damn, you don't have a program
   to read it. <br>You need to go online, search for a website that will let you download Adobe Reader (or another PDF viewer),
   download it, install it,  maybe even reboot.<br><br>
2.  Whew, all right, now you're all set. Attached to your friend's email you find a text document, file.doc.
  Your Windows can't read that either, right now: great.<br> Either you go buy your copy of Microsoft Office, or you just
 download OpenOffice(A Linux Distro Product), but still, you need to find it, download it (let's hope you have a broadband connection), install it,
 etc.<br><br>
 3.  Your friend also sent you an image, but it has a bad contrast, bad luminosity, and needs a good crop. you can now go
  and buy Photoshop (how many hundred bucks is that again?), or download the GIMP(A Linux Distro Product) as much same as
  Photoshop) : search, download, install, etc.<br>
  That's enough : you get the idea, Windows is far from complete, and installing it is just the beginning of trouble.<br><br>
 4. When you get Linux (such as Ubuntu, ArchLinux, LinuxMint, Mandriva, Fedora, Kali, Debian, Elementry etc., these
  are different "flavors" of Linux), you also get, without installing anything more :<br><br>
  i) Everything you need to write texts, edit spreadsheets, make neat presentations, draw, edit equations.<br>
  ii) A web browser (eg Firefox) and an email program (eg Thunderbird, or Evolution).<br>
  iii) An image editor (GIMP) nearly as powerful as Photoshop.<br>
  iv) An instant messenger.<br>
  v) A movie player.<br>
  vi) A music player and organizer.<br>
  vii) A PDF reader.<br>
  viii) Everything you need to uncompress archives (ZIP, etc.) means atleast WINRAR.<br>
  ix) MOST IMPORTANT : You must have to buy a Antivirus or download a huge size of free version and bother about its activation
    and we don't share our files from other disks due to virus, start system and scan every time, when a new drive pluged in 
    system then wait for scaning for long time, alots problem(you probably know much more).<br>
  x)  For developer linux provides much more Packages which comes up with OS as : JAVA, GCC, PYTHON, CMAKE etc.<br>
  xi) etc.<br>
