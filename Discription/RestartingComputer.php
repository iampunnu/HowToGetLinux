 <h1 style="font-size:30px;"> Are your tired of restarting your computer all the time? </h1>
<h4>
 <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">1. </em> Have you just upgraded one or two little things on your Windows system with
  "Windows update"? Please reboot. Have you just installed some new software? Please reboot. Does your system seem unstable?
   Try to reboot, everything will probably work better after that.
 <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
 <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">2. </em> Windows always asks you to restart your computer, and that can be annoying
  (maybe you happen to have a long download going on, and you don't want to interrupt it just because you updated a few pieces 
  of your system).
  <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
  <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">3. </em>  But even if you click "Restart later", Windows still keeps bothering you 
  every ten minutes to let you know that you really should restart the computer. And if you happen to be away from your computer
  and you didn't see the question, it will happily reboot automatically. Bye bye long download.
 <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">4. </em> Linux basically doesn't need to restart. Whether you install new software 
 (even very big programs) or perform routine upgrades for your system, you will not be asked to restart the computer. It is only
 necessary when a part from the heart of the system has been updated, and that only happens once every several weeks.
<div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">5. </em> Do you know Internet servers? They're the big computers that answer you 
 when you ask for a web page, and send the information to your browser. Most of them run Linux, and since they need to always
 be available (a visitor could come anytime).<br>They aren't restarted very often (services aren't available while the system is starting).
 Actually, many of them haven't restarted for several years. Linux is stable, it runs perfectly well without restarting all the time.
 <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
<em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">6. </em> You'll probably not let your computer stay on for several weeks  but the point
  is: the system won't bother you with restarting all the time.
