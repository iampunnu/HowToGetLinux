<h4>
 <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">1. </em> One of the great assets of the Open Source community (and Linux in particular), is that it's a real community. Users and
   developers really are out there, on web forums, on mailing lists, on IRC channels, helping out new users. They're all happy
   to see more and more people switch to Linux, and they're happy to help them get a grip on their new system.
   <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
  <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">2. </em> So if there's something you don't understand, a program that doesn't 
    behave the way you would expect, or a feature that you can't seem to find, don't hesitate to go and ask for help. 
    If there's somebody near you (family? co-workers?) who is using Linux.
   <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>
   <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">3. </em>  he or she will probably be happy to help you out. Otherwise, just go 
   online and you'll find literally thousands of places where nice people will answer you and walk you out of your problem most
   of the time: geeks actually are very nice people.
  <div class="hr1" style="margin-bottom:8px;"></div>  
   <em style="color:green;font-size:30px;">4. </em> if you ask your question politely. Just type "linux help" (or replace "linux" 
    with whatever distribution you chose -- see the install section) in Google and you'll undoubtedly find everything you need.
